# Hiko

A simple service watchdog, designed to be lightweight and performant.

**It is now in active development and not yet functional.**

`Hiko` is designed to work in headless mode, users are highly encouraged to build their own control panel using the
provided api (building documentation) or directly access through web requests.
Anyhow, an example version was provided at [frontend](frontend) directory.
